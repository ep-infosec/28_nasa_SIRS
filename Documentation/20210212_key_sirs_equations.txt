1.  INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this document is to recast the key equations from Rauscher,
B. J. et al. "Improved reference sampling and subtraction: A technique for
reducing the read noise of near-infrared detector systems",
PASP 129, 105003-- (2017) into a more suitable form for this application. 
Dale Fixsen first derived these equations for the JWST Near Infrared 
Spectrograph.

Here is how the equations currently appear in the paper.

α = (Y - f f* X Z/P) / (R - f f* Z Z*/P)
β = f * (X R/P - YZ*/P) / (R - f f* Z Z*/P)

N = norm norm*
R = ref ref*
P = rho rho*
X = norm rho*
Y = norm ref*
Z = rho ref*

Here, "norm" = normal pixels, "ref" = reference pixels, and "rho" = the
reference output. These are all in the Fourier domain.

2. REVISED NOMENCLATURE

It will be helpful to have new, more intuitive symbols for all of them in
IRS. Therefore, assign as follow:

"norm" -> 𝓷,
"ref" -> 𝓵,
"rho" -> 𝓻,
"R" -> 𝕃, and
"P" -> ℝ,

and so on. With these substitutions, the original equations become the
following.

α = (𝕐 - f f* 𝕏 ℤ/ℝ) / (𝕃 - f f* ℤ ℤ*/ℝ) # Operates on left ref. cols.
β = f * (𝕏 𝕃/ℝ - 𝕐ℤ*/ℝ) / (𝕃 - f f* ℤ ℤ*/ℝ) # Operates on right ref cols.

ℕ = 𝓷 𝓷*  # Normal
𝕃 = 𝓵 𝓵*  # Left
ℝ = 𝓻 𝓻*  # Right
𝕏 = 𝓷 𝓻*  # Mixed...
𝕐 = 𝓷 𝓵*
ℤ = 𝓻 𝓵*
