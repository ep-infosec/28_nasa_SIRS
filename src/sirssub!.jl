    sirssub(SIRSCore, D; f_max=nothing, rowsonly=false)

SIRS reference subtraction.

    Parameters: sc::SIRSCore
                  A loaded SIRSCore structure
                D::Array{Float64,3}
                  A sampled up-the-ramp datacube
                f_max::Float64
                  Maximum frequency to use. Weights for higher
                  frequencies are zeroed out. If not set, all available
                  frequencies are used
                rowsonly::Bool
                  This is mostly for debugging. Use it to turn of SIRS
                  correction and apply only a legacy rowsonly correction

            being on the edges, so use only the two center rows. Per a request from Chris
            Willott, treat the middle outputs differently to suppress ACN. For the first and
            last outputs, SIRS picks up ACN at Nyquist. For these, there is nothing
